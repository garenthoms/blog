The first part to the system is to determine the long term fundamental trend on any currency. 

We want to know when it started and when it ended 

(And remember that the long term movement of a currency usually caused by government policy and can be easily seen if you know what you are looking for.) 

You might ask the question. 

How do we find that out? 

Secret 1: You can only find it on the monthly chart. This is were we'll use technical analysis. 

   indicator (moving average). 

Its a 2MA open on a monthly chart. 

Let me show you some example from some major currency.. 

I want you to notice the yellow line in each picture. 

USDJPY
From 2014 till 2022 

usdjpy fundamental change direction 6 times in 8 years 

GBPUSD
From 2014 till 2022 

Gbpusd fundamental change direction 7 times in 8 years 

The beauty of knowing this is to trade it on a lower time frame. 

Time frame we going to look on is 4hour chart 

Secret 2: You will need some basic maths that we all learn in school 

And it goes like this. 

    2MA monthly X 4 weeks in a month = to 8MA 

So the 2MA on a monthly chart is now 8MA on a Weekly chart 

8MA X 5days in a week = to 40MA 

So the 2MA on a monthly chart is now 40MA on a daily chart 

40MA X 6-4hr candles in a day = to 240MA 

So the 2MA on the monthly chart is now 240MA on a 4hr chart.. 

So now im going to show you weekly, Daily and the 4 Hour chart 

We going to use USDJPY 

It add a 18 months run.. 

Weekly chart
Daily chart
4 Hour chart 

Now the trading rule is very simple, BUY above the 240MA line and SELL below the 240MA 

This way we keep track of the institutional banks and gov't and let the other 99% of retail Traders watch the news and lose all their funds.. 

I have paid 15kusd to learn what im telling you.. i could have charge for it but im here to help.. 

And there is alot more to the system.. this is just the first part.
