I have come to understand that they're 2 types of traders.. 

1: TECHNICAL TRADERS 
2: FUNDAMENTAL TRADERS 

TECHNICAL TRADERS 

These are traders who use indicators to make decisions to trade, when to exit and enter and there are thousands of different kinds of indicators but they usually fit into 2 groups. 

1: indicators that are based on moving averages with some kind of math formula 

2: indicators that don't move and are static that are based on a previous high or low like fibs or pivot, trend lines, support and resistance lines, etc. 

FUNDAMENTAL TRADERS 

These are traders who use events to make decisions to trade with a short-term or long-term. 

1: Short Term Events like if a country increase/decrease interest rates that will usually move a currency pair anywhere from 3 days to several weeks depending on how big the rate change was. 

2: Lond Term Events like govt policy that will move a currency pair for months or even years. 

What im going to teach is to use both technical analysis and fundamental. 

We will use a very simple indicator to determine the long term fundamental trend. 

That way we dont need to know the information that is actually driving this long-term trend. 

We will spot it with technical analysis and adjust our trading accordingly. 

And let the other 99% of traders that dont understand forex pay us.. lol 

Knowledgeable is a key thing to my trading system. 

Because i know the short and long term fundamental on any currency pair.
