WHAT IS FOREX 

Simply put forex is about the exchange of money between nations, corporations, businesses and individuals that produce over 3-5 trillion dollars a day in exchanges. 

I have paid $15,000.00 USD to learn one and one from someone for 6 months that use to work in the bank that trade for themself now.. thats $2,220,000 JMD. At the time 

So you best pay attention 

It is important you understand that the Forex Markets is not move by traders or investors. 

It move by countries and companies 

Eg: at anytime Company A from Country Z will exchange money from Company B in Country X. 



I dont need to place a stop lost when entering a trade but i do know that if in some case something goes against my beliefs. 

I will take 1/2% or 2% max loss on a trade with a very larger account.. 

But on a small account that will be about 10 or 20% max loss
