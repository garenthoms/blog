WHAT IS FOREX 

Simply put forex is about the exchange of money between nations, corporations, businesses and individuals that produce over 3-5 trillion dollars a day in exchanges. 

I have paid $15,000.00 USD to learn one and one from someone for 6 months that use to work in the bank that trade for themself now.. thats $2,220,000 JMD. At the time 

So you best pay attention 

It is important you understand that the Forex Markets is not move by traders or investors. 

It move by countries and companies 

Eg: at anytime Company A from Country Z will exchange money from Company B in Country X. 

I have come to understand that they're 2 types of traders.. 

1: TECHNICAL TRADERS 
2: FUNDAMENTAL TRADERS 

TECHNICAL TRADERS 

These are traders who use indicators to make decisions to trade, when to exit and enter and there are thousands of different kinds of indicators but they usually fit into 2 groups. 

1: indicators that are based on moving averages with some kind of math formula 

2: indicators that don't move and are static that are based on a previous high or low like fibs or pivot, trend lines, support and resistance lines, etc. 

FUNDAMENTAL TRADERS 

These are traders who use events to make decisions to trade with a short-term or long-term. 

1: Short Term Events like if a country increase/decrease interest rates that will usually move a currency pair anywhere from 3 days to several weeks depending on how big the rate change was. 

2: Lond Term Events like govt policy that will move a currency pair for months or even years. 

What im going to teach is to use both technical analysis and fundamental. 

We will use a very simple indicator to determine the long term fundamental trend. 

That way we dont need to know the information that is actually driving this long-term trend. 

We will spot it with technical analysis and adjust our trading accordingly. 

And let the other 99% of traders that dont understand forex pay us.. lol 

Knowledgeable is a key thing to my trading system. 

Because i know the short and long term fundamental on any currency pair. 

I dont need to place a stop lost when entering a trade but i do know that if in some case something goes against my beliefs. 

I will take 1/2% or 2% max loss on a trade with a very larger account.. 

But on a small account that will be about 10 or 20% max loss
